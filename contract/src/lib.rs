/// This is the foundational contract for the Stellar Guilds platform.
/// It enables users to create guilds, add members, assign roles, and manage
/// permissions on-chain. This forms the foundation for decentralized communities,
/// voting, and role-based governance.
///
/// # Core Features
/// - Guild creation with metadata
/// - Member management with role assignments
/// - Permission-based access control
/// - Event tracking for all state changes
/// - Efficient on-chain storage management
